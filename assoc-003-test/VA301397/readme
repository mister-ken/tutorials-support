There are three Vault policies for developers at your organization displayed in the Exhibit space.  
 
There is already a KV-V2 secrets engine named dev-team created. 

Once these policies are assigned to a new developer, what do the policies in the Exhibit space allow them to do?

Create a secret named dev-team/creds.

List secrets located at dev-team/creds.

Read a secret at dev-team/data/creds.

Create secrets engines named creds.

To test:

1. just VA301397
2. login
   ```bash 
   vault login \     
   -method=userpass \
   -token-only username=danielle \
   password='test-pass'
   ```
3. use that token to reset the VAULT_TOKEN env variable.
4. `vault token lookup` path should be `auth/userpass/login/danielle`
5. read the secret at: 
   ```bash
   vault read dev-team/data/creds
   Key         Value
   ---         -----
   data        map[login:me password:ipass]
   metadata    map[created_time:2025-02-03T20:06:07.983322Z custom_metadata:<nil> deletion_time: destroyed:false version:1]
   ```
